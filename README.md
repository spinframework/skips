# SKIPs

A SpinKube Improvement Proposal (SKIP) is a way to propose, communicate and
coordinate changes for the SpinKube project.

## Quickstart

1. Socialize an idea with the relevant maintainers, you can reach out to people
   privately, via the #spinkube channel in the CNCF Slack, or by joining a SpinKube
   community meeting and adding it to the agenda.
2. Follow the process outlined in the [SKIP Template](proposals/NNN-skip-template/README.md).
